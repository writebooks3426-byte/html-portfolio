<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>My website will be called StellaHudsonWrites.com.  I'm going to write about the triumphs, tragedies and humor of writing.  My goal is to log 
  my 10,000 hours to magnificence.  I'll talk about trying to write a story my way.  So let's get going.   I'll also mention books I've read that have helped me become a better 
  writer.  Hopfully that will bring shout-outs from people who 
  are already published.  I'll start with the "Steal Like an Artist" series by Austin Kleon.  These books are amazing!!  Short and to the point.  I learned so much in such a short span of time.
One of the main takeaways was creating your own website to publicize your work.  Read and noted.  Thank you Austin!  I am going to spend Fall/Winter learning website developement and writing my story.
Am I biting off more than I can chew?  I won't know until I find out.  You may get to see a creative breakdown in real time! LOL!!</p>

<p>I also love sports.  My favorite teams are the Pittsburgh Steelers, the Liverpool Football Team, the Cleveland Guardians and  
  Washington Nationals, Pittsburgh Penguins, the Duke Blue Devils and now the Dallas Mavericks.  They got Cooper Flagg! I gotta go with them! 
</p>
<p>To keep my mind busy outside of writing and reading, I do trivia once a week at a friend's wine shop.  I create my own themes and decks.  I not only learn something new every week, it also gets me out the house!</p>

<p>I need to get started on my novel though.  Novel(S)!! I have lots of stories to tell and people to introduce to the world.  I
  unfortunately procrastinate so right now, those stories are stuck in my head. Hopefully with this website up and running, I can start
  to write them down soon.  Once you tell the world you're writing, there's no going back.
</p>

<p>So here we go.  I'm starting at the bottom.  But I'm not staying there for long!!</p>
