<h1>THE BEST MOVIES ACCORDING TO SHIRLEY</h1><br />
 <h2>My Top 3 Movies of All Time.</h2>
 <hr />
 <h3>The Empire Strikes Back</h3>
 <p>Darth Vader at his best.  The music is incredible.  The dual story lines about Luke's training and Hans and Leia go well together.</p>
 <h3>Dark Knight</h3>
 <p>Movie of my lifetime.  How far can someone be pushed to the dark side?  Heath Ledger killed it as Joker.  And of course Christian Bale IS The Dark Knight.  Christopher Nolan IS the filmmaker of our generation.</p>
 <h3>Captain America: Civil War</h3>
 <p>How far will you go for friendship?  Waht's more important?  The majority's opinion or what you feel in your soul?  AND they got Spiderman?  Amazing movie.  There are no winners here.</p>
